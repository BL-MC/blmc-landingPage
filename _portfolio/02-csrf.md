### Superconducting RF Accelerators
Electron beams are an exceptional source of energy that are capable of initiating chemical reactions without the need for catalysts, high temperature or high pressure. The high kinetic energy and penetrating nature of the electrons provide significant benefits over typical chemical methods.

Superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavities enable accelerators to generate high-energy beams over short distances. With SRF cavities, it is possible to build compact linear accelerators — less than 1.5 meters in length — that can accelerate electron beams beyond 10 MeV, with average beam powers in the tens of kilowatts. Such compact SRF accelerators can have high wall-plug power efficiencies and require smaller radiation enclosures, reducing overall installation costs.
