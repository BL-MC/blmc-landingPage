### Features
The Blinky-Max31865 System is a precision 4 wire temperature measurement system based on the MAX31865 chip. Each module: 
- contains two channels with 15 bits of resolution. 
- is wireless and requires no communication cables.
- is low power requiring a power source between 3.7 to 5.2V and draws a maximum current of 65mA 
- can be operated in pulse mode. The minium length of the current excitation pulse is 100 mS
- packaged in a 4-mod wide DIN enclosure

The system allows the user to enter eighth order calibration curves for each temperature channel. The curves can be either a Taylor series expansion or a Chebyschev polynomial.
