    title: "About Us"
#    text: "our story"
    body: "We have a combined experience of 45 years building particle accelerators. Downtime for these ultra complex machines can cost users hundreds of thousands of euros per day. So, we developed a radically new concept for remote access controls for the premiere accelerator facilities in Sweden. This system gives experts access to the machines around the clock from anywhere in the world so they can spot issues before they become problems and fix problems before they become downtime. We know that downtime is not only a killer for big science but for the manufacturing sector as well. So, we have spun-off the same technology we use for maintaining top performance at particle accelerators. The result is Blinky-Lite, a secure remote access control system that easily integrates into the manufacturing sector."
