<p>During the 2023-2024 Winter shutdown over 700 meters of Blinky-Leak detector was made operational in the MaxIV computer server rooms and the 520 meter 3 GeV Ring. Fourteen wireless Blinky-Leak cubes that could read two 20 meter long detectors comprise the system. The complete system is operational and connected to the MaxIV notification system.</p>

<p>On Friday 5-July 2024, the Blinky-Lite water leak detector system at MaxIV sent out a notification that there was a leak in Sector 14. At first the leak subsided but then returned and grew steadily worse over the weekend. Since there was no staff available on the MaxIV site during the weekend, repair crews could not investigate until the following Monday. On Monday 8-July, the repair crew found a cooling hose leaking in Sector 14 and promptly repaired it.</p>

<p>Since water leaks rarely get better by themselves and often can become catastrophically worse, the prompt notification to remote observers by the Blinky-Lite water leak detector system during a vacation period when few staff were present probably saved MaxIV from a costly repair and cleanup.</p>
