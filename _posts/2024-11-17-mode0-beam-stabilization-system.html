<p><b><i>Place of installation:</i></b> <a href="https://www.maxiv.lu.se/">MAX IV</a> laboratory in Lund/Sweden</p>

<p><b><i>Background:</i></b> Many of the latest generation light sources are transitioning to long bunch operation to dramatically improve beam brightness. However, most particle accelerator bunch lengthening systems inherently introduce instabilities that can severely impact beam brightness.</p>

<p><b><i>Implementation:</i></b> A compact Mode 0 beam stabilization system based on incorporating the Red Pitaya Stemlab 125-14LN into the Blinky-Lite platform has been commissioned at MAX IV. The system enables long bunch operation at high beam intensities with record beam brightness.</p>

<p><b><i>Benefit:</i></b> In long bunch mode, which is needed for a bright beam, MAX IV was previously limited to under 125mA but thanks to the beam stabilization system is now operating at 400 mA. The Red Pitaya Mode 0 system has been operating for over a year without causing any down-time to the accelerator.</p>

<p><b><i>Our offering:</i></b>  The compact Mode 0 beam stabilization system can be easily integrated in almost any other light source.</p>
