<p><b><i>Place of installation:</i></b> <a href="https://mirrotron.com/en">Mirrotron</a> laboratory in Martonv치s치r/Hungary</p>

<p><b><i>Background:</i></b> The Mirrotron Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) is part of a compact neutron source that is being built in Martonv치s치r Hungary.</p>

<p>The 2.5 MeV RFQ designed and built by Time Co, Ltd., Japan is a pulsed accelerator that can support 1.25 mS pulses at a rate of 40 Hz for a maximum duty factor of 5% . The RFQ can accelerate a peak beam current of 20 mA with an input RF power 260 kW at 200 MHz. providing an average beam power of 2.5 kW. The loaded cavity Q is 10,000 which results in a cavity bandwidth of 20 kHz.</p>

<p>The RFQ accelerator system can be divided into 5 major subsystems</p>
<li>RF source (LLRF)</li>
<li>Timing system</li>
<li>200 MHz RF power amplifier</li>
<li>Vacuum system</li>
<li>Cooling system</li>

<p><b><i>Implementation:</i></b> Each of the above mentioned systems has been integrated into Blinky-Lite. Commercial equipment such as vacuum pumps and gauges (i.e. Pfeiffer TC 400 turbo pump drive unit and TPG 366 gauge controller) as well as the 200 MHz power amplifier from R&K company were integrated using <i>Blinky-Bus</i>, a standard Blinky-Lite template for serial communication. For all other systems control hard- and software has been built from scratch.</p>

<p>A detailed description of the control system can be found <a href="https://bl-mirrotron.github.io/">here</a>.</p>

<p><b><i>Benefit:</i></b> Using Blinky-Lite, it was possible to provide a full-stack control system for the RFQ in short time (<6 months) and at reasonable cost.</p>

<p><b><i>Our offering:</i></b> We are able to offer a complete RFQ control system consisting of the above mentioned subsystems. Individual subsystems, such as the timing or LLRF systems can be provided as well.</p>
